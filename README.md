# ðŸš— Car Specification Chatbot (LangGraph + OpenAI GPT-3.5)

A simple command-line chatbot that provides detailed specifications for car models using the power of [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) and OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo`.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- Ask about any car model (e.g., **"Tell me about Hyundai Ioniq 5"**)
- Get a structured response including:
  - Engine type
  - Fuel efficiency
  - Top speed
  - Key features
  - Approximate price
- Powered by OpenAI GPT-3.5 and LangGraph for stateful reasoning

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-spec-chatbot.git
cd car-spec-chatbot
````

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set your OpenAI API Key

You can set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"  # On Windows use `set`
```

Or directly replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` in the code (not recommended for production).

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

Run the chatbot from the terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

Youâ€™ll see:

```
ðŸš— Car Specification Chatbot (LangGraph + GPT-3.5)
Type 'exit' to quit.
```

Then ask questions like:

```
> Tell me about Tesla Model S
```

## ðŸ§  How It Works

* **LangGraph** defines a simple state machine with a single node: `get_specs`.
* The node takes a user's car query, builds a prompt, and sends it to **OpenAI GPT-3.5**.
* The model responds with a structured car specification summary.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* [OpenAI Python SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-python)
* [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)
